Welcome to SimpleLLM, a straightforward implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) designed for educational purposes and experimentation. This project aims to provide a clear and concise codebase to understand the core concepts behind modern LLMs.

## Overview

SimpleLLM is built to demonstrate the fundamental architecture and training procedures of LLMs.  While it's a simplified version, it incorporates key features found in more complex models, providing a solid foundation for learning and further development.
